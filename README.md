## Recommended Connector Pinning:
![Pinning1](https://github.com/Luddi96/BREmote/blob/main/img/pinning1.png) ![Pinning2](https://github.com/Luddi96/BREmote/blob/main/img/pinning2.png)

## Usage:
- With the remote off, push the toggle forward to turn it on
- As long as you keep the toggle forward, you will be shown the internal battery capacity in %
- With `//#define NO_LOCK` disabled in SHARED_CONFIG.h:
	- The remote will start in locked state
	- Push the toggle down to unlock
	- The remote will show you "PP", demanding you to push the trigger to its maximum position
	- Once you release the trigger, the remote will be in operating state
	- Push the toggle up/down to increase/decrease gear (The remote will always start in *lowest* gear)
	- Push and hold the toggle down to lock again
	- Push and hold the toggle up to turn off the remote
- With `#define NO_LOCK` enabled in SHARED_CONFIG.h:
	- The remote will immediately start in unlocked state
	- Push the toggle up/down to increase/decrease gear  (The remote will always start in *highest* gear)
	- Push and hold the toggle up to turn off the remote

## Status Codes:
| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| [] |System Locked |
| PP |Press Trigger once to arm |
| L0-L9 |Current "Gear", use Toggle to change |
| UU |Undervoltage, charge Battery |

## Error Codes:
| Err Code | Meaning | Potential Causes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E3 | Packet Content Invalid | Unexpected data received, probably due to SW error or signal interference |
| E4 | No Ack | No acknowledgement from Receiver, signal too weak or signal interference |
| E5 | EEPROM Error | Unexpected/no calibration in EEPROM, try calibrating the remote again |
| E6 | NRF Module | NRF (Wireless) Module can't be initialized, probably hardware fault |
| E7 | Water Ingress | Water on the water detection electrodes attached to the receiver. This feature can be disabled in code if you dont use it (default: enabled). |
| E8 | BMS Fault | BMS has disabled its output connected to the receiver. This feature can be disabled in code if you dont use it (default: disabled). |

# FAQ:
Q: When trying to program the remote with the Arduino IDE, I get an error "avrdude: stk500_getsync()"
A: Make sure you selected "Arduino Nano ATmega328P **(Old Bootloader)**"
